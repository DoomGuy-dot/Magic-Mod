## General info
This a Terraria mod made by ~~me~~ Zephyr, a solo game developer and rising programmer.
The Mod is designed to enhance Terraria's already advanced Magic system by giving players new ways to be a Mage through new items, effects, enemies, and the like.
Magic-Mod is not meant to give players super overpowered items to trivialize the game, it is simply supposed to enhance the Terraria experience with more options and ways to play. (At some point, Boss fights post Moon-Lord could be added, in which case new, more powerful items would need to be available to the player.)

Currently (As of July 17, 2020), the mod is only 2 days into development.
I have not made a mod before this one, for any game, but I am learning how to use tModLoader to make this mod as awesome as possible! Just stick with me and eventually at some point you maybe just might possibly get some new boss fights or something. ;)
